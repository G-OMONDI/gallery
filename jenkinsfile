// This Jenkinsfile defines a simple pipeline with one stage that prints a message to the console.
// It uses the declarative syntax of Jenkins pipelines, which is more structured and easier to read.
// The `agent any` directive allows the pipeline to run on any available agent.
// The `echo` step is used to print messages to the console output.
// This pipeline can be used to verify that Jenkins is set up correctly and can execute basic tasks
